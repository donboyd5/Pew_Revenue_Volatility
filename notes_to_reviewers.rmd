# System setup

-   make sure that you can find in the share drive
    -   the project directory `Pew_Revenue_Volatility`

    -   the data directory `data`
-   make sure you have:
    -   R version 4.1.2 or later installed

    -   a recent version of RStudio installed

        -   I ran this with daily build `RStudio-2022.02.0-432` (see [here](https://dailies.rstudio.com/) but you should be able to run everything with the latest released version

        -   If any troubles, please email me ([mailto:donboyd5\\\@gmail.com](mailto:donboyd5\@gmail.com){.uri})
-   copy the entire project directory `Pew_Revenue_Volatility` from the share drive to your machine
-   open the file `constants_system.r` in the `r` folder of the project - **(I recommend doing this with a text editor at this point, rather than opening it in RStudio, as that will trigger actions you might rather not have happen yet - nothing fatal, but you'll be waiting for those actions to end before you can proceed)**
    -   you will see my system-specific information:

        -   global directory names mapped to folder locations on my computer

        -   my FRED API key

    -   modify `constants_system.r` by commenting-out my system-specific information and putting yours in

        -   map directories on your computer, with whatever names you want, to the global variables in `constants_system.r`; as of this writing, the global variables are `beadir`, `qcewdir`, and `scratchdir` but there could be more or different global variables by the time you read this

        -   if you don't have a FRED API key you can either use mine or just put in any old string I think - so that you have the exact data I have, you can use the data I provide with the project - in other words, best NOT to download new data from FRED anyway because data may have been revised (very slightly) after I last downloaded it
-   copy data from the share drive `data` subdirectories to the directories you are using
    -   if your review requires you to go to the original source of these files:

        -   I'd suggest you do that after first running things using the data I downloaded and put in these directories

        -   then, if you want to download from source, in the \`prep_data.r\` program you will see commented-out code that downloads files I used

        -   however because data can be revised this may lead to different results from mine; I would expect the differences to be miniscule

# Project setup

-   start RStudio

-   open the project file `Pew_Revenue_Volatility.Rproj` in RStudio

-   wait for it to finish examining the packages the project uses

    -   when I did this to check transferring from one computer to another it gave me warnings about `DESCRIPTION` files missing from 9 packages

    -   I went ahead with the next step anyway and all worked

-   at the console, enter `renv::restore()`

    -   wait for it to finish installing packages; it will take a while

    -   this, too, gave me warnings, noting that `DESCRIPTION` files were missing for the packages `cluster`, `KernSmooth`, and `codetools`

-   assuming all good, proceed to "Check the setup"

# Check the setup

-   open `libs_base.r` in the `r` folder

    -   step through the `library(â€¦)` statements one by one, making sure each library is installed; when I did this, there were no errors or warnings

    -   you'll install several packages that I created; they should install without trouble; if you want to verify how they were constructed, check the project directory `renv/local`, which has the source code for each package; also, [<https://github.com/donboyd5>]

        -   `bdata` - selected datasets; this project uses `sgtax.a` (annual state government tax data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census) and `recessions` (official recession dates from the National Bureau of Economic Research)

        -   `bggtools` - selected functions and themes to use with the package `ggplot2`

        -   `bmaps` - longitude and latitude data to use in maps of the U.S.

        -   `btools` - miscellaneous utility and statistical functions

        -   `BEAData` - annual, quarterly, and monthly data from the National Income and Products Accounts (NIPA) from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis; this project uses `nipa`

        -   `BLSdata` - monthly data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; this project uses ...

        -   `qtax` - quarterly tax revenue data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census

-   repeat with `libs_ts.r`; these, too, should install without trouble

# Data preparation

-   open `prep_data.r` in the `r` project folder

-   you'll see my notes about how to navigate the code efficiently

-   step through the program bit by bit - do not try to run it all at once

-   this will create the RData files

    -   general.RData

    -
