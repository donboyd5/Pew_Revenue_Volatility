# System setup

-   make sure that you can find in the share drive
    -   the project directory `Pew_Revenue_Volatility`

    -   the data directory `data`
-   make sure you have:
    -   R version 4.1.2 or later installed

    -   a recent version of RStudio installed

    -   if any troubles, please email [me](mailto:donboyd5@gmail.com)
-   copy the entire project directory `Pew_Revenue_Volatility` from the share drive to your machine
-   using a text editor, open `constants_system.r` (it is in the `r` folder of the project) - **(I recommend doing this with a text editor at this point, rather than opening it in RStudio, as that will trigger actions you might rather not have happen yet - nothing fatal, but you'll be waiting for those actions to end before you can proceed)**
    -   you will see my system-specific information:

        -   global directory names mapped to folder locations on my computer

        -   my FRED API key

    -   modify `constants_system.r` by commenting-out my system-specific information and putting yours in

        -   map directories on your computer, with whatever names you want, to the global variables in `constants_system.r`; as of this writing, the global variables are `beadir`, `qcewdir`, and `scratchdir` but there could be more or different global variables by the time you read this

        -   if you don't have a FRED API key you can either keep mine uncommented in the `constants_system.r` file or put in any old string in

            -   I have preloaded certain data from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) and stored it in the project (just the unemployment rate, I think) and commented-out the download code, so you don't need the FRED key unless you decide to download that data yourself

            -   if you do so, you can use my key or use your own

            -   if you do so you may get slightly different numbers than me, if the data have been revised since I downloaded them
-   copy data from the share drive `data` subdirectories to the directories you are using (the directories you named in `constants_system.r`)
    -   if your review requires you to go to the original source of these files:

        -   I'd suggest you do that after first running things using the data I downloaded and put in these directories

        -   then, if you want to download from source, in the \`prep_data.r\` program you will see commented-out code that downloads files I used

        -   however because data can be revised this may lead to different results from mine; I would expect the differences to be miniscule

# Project setup

-   start RStudio

-   open the project file `Pew_Revenue_Volatility.Rproj` in RStudio

-   wait for it to finish examining the packages the project uses

    -   when I did this to verify that I can transfer from one computer of mine to another it gave me warnings about `DESCRIPTION` files missing from 9 packages

    -   I went ahead with the next step anyway and all worked

-   at the console, enter `renv::restore()`

    -   wait for it to finish installing packages; it will take a while

    -   this, too, gave me warnings, noting that `DESCRIPTION` files were missing for the packages `cluster`, `KernSmooth`, and `codetools`

-   assuming all good, proceed to "Check the setup"

# Check the setup

-   from within RStudio, open `libs_base.r`, which is in the `r` folder

    -   step through (execute) the `library(â€¦)` statements one by one, making sure each library is installed and can load; when I did this on my transferee computer, there were no errors or warnings

    -   in addition to official CRAN packages, this step will install several packages that I created; they should install without trouble; if you want to verify how they were constructed, check the project directory `renv/local`, which has the source code for each package; also, they are [here](https://github.com/donboyd5)

        -   `bdata` - includes two data frames I created: `sgtax.a` (annual state government tax data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census) and `recessions` (official recession dates from the National Bureau of Economic Research)

            -   code that is in the data-raw directory of the `bdata` package (if you go to the source) downloads and gets the data; I would not recommend doing this; if you want to check the data, instead I would suggest spot-checking some numbers against the Census website; there are other ways to check, also; if you want thoughts on that, please let me know

        -   `bggtools` - selected functions and themes to use with the package `ggplot2`; simple stuff - I don't think you'll feel a need to do anything with this

        -   `bmaps` - has two data frames I created, with longitude/latitude for the U.S.: `states49`, which has long/lat for the 48 continental states and DC, and `states51`, with long/lat for the 50 states, with AK and HI as insets below the continental U.S., plus DC (I use `states51` in the project)

        -   `btools` - miscellaneous utility and statistical functions; nothing to do here; if you want to see a function, just type its name at the console --- e.g., typing "ht" will show you that `ht` is a function that displays the head and the tail of an object

        -   `BEAData` - includes the data frame `nipa`, which I created from data I downloaded from the BEA site; it has annual, quarterly, and monthly data from the National Income and Products Accounts (NIPA) from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis; if you type `comment(nipa)` it will tell you the download date; I try to follow this convention for most data files in packages; the source code for the package downloads and parses BEA data

        -   `BLSdata` - monthly data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; this project uses ...

        -   `qtax` - quarterly tax revenue data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census; has the data frame `qtax`, which has data I downloaded from the Census web site

-   repeat with `libs_ts.r`; these are packages for dealing with time-series data; I did not write any of them so it should be straightforward; they, too, should install without trouble

# Data preparation

-   open `prep_data.r` in the `r` project folder

    -   you'll see my notes about how to navigate the code efficiently

    -   the program loads subprograms to accomplish major tasks

        -   gather, organize and save major categories of data

        -   "stack" the separate data files

        -   construct volatility measures

    -   the major gathering, organizing, and saving tasks are

        -   general data

        -   capital gains and agi data

        -   national economic data

        -   state gdp data

        -   tax data

    -   step through the program bit by bit - do not try to run it all at once (although that will work, if your goal is to look at the final result)

    -   this will create the RData files needed for the analysis program

-   

# Analysis

-   open Pew_Tax_Volatility.rmd

-   step through the chunks one at a time

-   this will produce all of the figures, maps, and tables in the report

-   and will calculate and print certain facts that are inline in the report text
