# Pew RRS team: ----
# All system-specific information should be isolated in this file, in particular:
#   any directories needed that are outside of the project direcgtory
#   API keys

# as of now (3/11/2022) the ONLY system-specific information is the
# FRED API key -- and you should not need one unless you decide you want to 
# download the unemployment rate from FRED.


# Directions: comment-out the Boyd locations and API keys below and
# put your own locations and keys in the Pew section
